abstract: "The integration  of  variability  models  (e.g.,  feature  models)  is considered an error-prone activity, which can consume a lot of effort  from  development  teams  working  in  parallel,  thereby compromising developers’ productivity as well as the quality of  software  developed.  For  this,  many  integration  techniques have  been  proposed  in  last  decades  to  support  developers  to integrate feature models. However, there is a lack of a generic architecture  that  helps  developers  to  produce  integration  tools in  the  current  literature.  To  overcome  this  shortcoming,  this work  proposes  a  flexible,  component-based  architecture  for supporting  the  integration  of  feature  models.  In  addition,  a model integration workflow for helping developers to improve the  understanding  of  the  crucial composition  activities  and their relationships is also presented."
